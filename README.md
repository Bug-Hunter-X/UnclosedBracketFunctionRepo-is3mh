This repository contains a simple Python code example demonstrating a common syntax error: an unclosed bracket in a function definition.  The bug.py file showcases the error, and bugSolution.py provides the corrected version. This is a great example to highlight how simple syntax errors can halt the execution of a program.  Understanding this type of error is crucial for debugging and writing clean, functional Python code.
